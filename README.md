This repository provides the implementation code (in **C++**) and partial test data for the paper: [**Piecewise-ICP: Efficient and Robust Registration for 4D Point Clouds in Permanent Laser Scanning**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2025.06.026), published in the ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

*__Piecewise-ICP__ can accurately register point cloud time series (__4D point clouds__) in a __robust__ and __efficient__ way, even when the point cloud undergoes large-scale deformation or changes.
It is a __target-free__ and __learning-free__ point cloud registration algorithm that does not rely on keypoint detection and matching, nor does it require color or intensity information. It operates directly on geometric structures and is particularly well-suited for __fine registration__ tasks in laser scanning-based deformation monitoring.*

## üìù Abstract
The permanent terrestrial laser scanning (PLS) system has significantly improved the temporal and spatial resolution of surface capture in geomonitoring tasks. Accurate registration of the four-dimensional (3D space + time) point clouds (4DPC) generated by PLS is the prerequisite for subsequent deformation analysis. However, due to the massive data volume and potential changes between scans, achieving automatic, efficient, and robust registration of 4DPC remains challenging, especially in scenarios lacking signalized and reliable targets. To address the challenges in target-free registration of 4DPC from PLS, we propose Piecewise-ICP, a robust and efficient fine registration method. Assuming the stable areas on monitored surfaces are locally planar, we employ supervoxel-based segmentation to generate planar patches from 4DPC. These patches are then refined and classified by comparing defined correspondence distances to a monotonically decreasing distance threshold, thus progressively eliminating unstable areas in an iterative process and preventing convergence to local minima. Subsequently, an improved point-to-plane ICP (Iterative Closest Point) is applied to the centroids of identified stable patches. We introduce the Level of Detection to determine the minimum distance threshold, mitigating the influence of outliers and surface changes on registration accuracy. Based on derived transformation uncertainties, we further smooth the transformation sequence using a Kalman filter, yielding more accurate registration parameters. We demonstrate our registration approach on two datasets: (1) Synthetic point cloud time series with predefined changes and transformation parameters, and (2) a real 4DPC dataset from a PLS system installed in the Alpine region for rockfall monitoring. Experimental results show that Piecewise-ICP improves the average registration accuracy by more than 50% compared to the target-based method and existing robust ICP variants such as Trimmed-ICP and Generalized-ICP.

  
<a name="installation"></a>
## üîß Installation
Building **Piecewise-ICP** in `Windows` requires the following compiler and library to be installed:
1. [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (**>= 2013**).
2. [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases) (**>= 1.8.0**)

<a name="instructions"></a>
## üìñ Instructions
The program provides two modes: **pairwise registration** and **4D point cloud registration**. The former only registers a single source point cloud to a target point cloud, while the latter can register a point cloud time series to a specified reference point cloud (usually set as the first scan).

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è ***Piecewise-ICP*** requires the following prerequisites to ensure successful registration:
1. **Coarse alignment** must be completed in advance. This algorithm assumes that the input point clouds are already roughly aligned within a reasonable error range.
2. **Stable overlapping areas** must exist between point clouds. _Piecewise-ICP_ is not suitable for global registration of scenarios with full-scene shift or deformation.

### Parameter configuration
All registration parameters (e.g., file path, patch size, distance threshold, visualization control, etc.) are specified in an external `.txt` configuration file:

```
string FolderFilePath1: full path of target point cloud (pairwise registration mode) or the folder path of point cloud time series (4D registration mode)
string FolderFilePath2: full path of source point cloud (pairwise registration mode) or output folder path (4D registration mode)
bool isSetResSVsize (yes-1, no-0): whether to manually set the average point spacing and the initial size of supervoxels
float PCres1 (m): manually set resolution of target cloud after subsampling
float PCres2 (m): manually set resolution of source cloud after subsampling
float SVsize1 (m): manually set initial size of supervoxels in target cloud (Empirically set to ten times PCres1)
float SVsize2 (m): manually set initial size of supervoxels in source cloud (Empirically set to ten times PCres2)
bool isSetDTinit (yes-1, no-0): whether to manually set the initial distance threshold
float DTinit (m): manually set initial distance threshold (Depending on the coarse alignment accuracy, it's recommended to set a few decimeters.)
float DTmin (m): minimum Level of Detection (For natural surfaces like landslides, it's recommended to set a few centimeters.)
bool isVisual (yes-1, no-0): whether to visualize processed results
```

### Output files
* The **pairwise registration** mode can output a 4x4 transformation matrix, six transformation parameters, the variance-covariance matrix (VCM), and standard deviations (STD) of transformation parameters in a `TransMatrix.txt` file. The registered source point cloud `RegisteredSourceCloud.pcd` is also output.
* The **4D registration** mode can output the transformation files for each determined pair (pairwise registration results) in `Epoch_PairMode_TransMatrix.txt` files, and the transformations to the reference epoch for all scans along with associated uncertainties (VCM and STD) in `TransMatrices_toRef.txt` and `TransParameters_toRef.txt` files.

## üöÄ Quick Use by Python
To quickly run Piecewise-ICP from [**Python**](python), you can simply call the provided C++ API via the precompiled DLL.  
You just need to place the `PCL_DLL/` [folder](python/PCL_DLL) (which contains all necessary `.dll` files) in your Python project directory, and then invoke the API functions `PiecewiseICP_pair_call` (for pairwise registration) or `PiecewiseICP_4D_call` (for 4D registration) from Python as shown below:

```python
import os
import ctypes

# Load the C++ DLL
CUR_PATH = os.path.dirname(__file__)
dllPath = os.path.join(CUR_PATH, "PCL_DLL/PwICP_x64R.dll")  # PwICP_x64R_withAccuracyAnalysis
mydll = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(dllPath)

# Define function signatures
mydll.PiecewiseICP_pair_call.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p, ctypes.c_char_p]
mydll.PiecewiseICP_pair_call.restype = ctypes.c_bool
mydll.PiecewiseICP_4D_call.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p, ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_float]
mydll.PiecewiseICP_4D_call.restype = ctypes.c_bool


# --- Example 1: Pairwise registration ---
conf_path_pair = "configuration_files/configuration_pair.txt"  # Chenge here! Path to config file
output_prefix = "results/PairReg/"                             # Chenge here! The prefix of output files
conf_bytes = ctypes.create_string_buffer(bytes(conf_path_pair, encoding='utf8'))
out_bytes = ctypes.create_string_buffer(bytes(output_prefix, encoding='utf8'))
success1 = mydll.PiecewiseICP_pair_call(conf_bytes, out_bytes)
print("\nPairwise registration success:", success1)


# --- Example 2: 4D point cloud registration ---
conf_path_4d = "configuration_files/configuration_4d.txt"  # Chenge here! Path to config file
start_epoch = 0          # Reference epoch index in the scan file list (0 as the first scan).
num_epochs = 20          # Total number of scans
pair_mode = -1           # Mode of pair sequence determination:
                            #  0: All scans to reference
                            # >0: Fixed interval
                            # <0: Adaptive interval
overlap_thd = 0.75       # Overlap ratio threshold for adaptive registration pairs (default: 75%)
conf_bytes_4d = ctypes.create_string_buffer(bytes(conf_path_4d, encoding='utf8'))
success2 = mydll.PiecewiseICP_4D_call(conf_bytes_4d, start_epoch, num_epochs, pair_mode, overlap_thd)
print("\n4DPC registration success:", success2)

```


üìå **Note**:
All registration parameters (e.g., scan paths, patch size, distance threshold) are specified in an external `.txt` configuration file, making it easy to control registration settings without modifying the code.
